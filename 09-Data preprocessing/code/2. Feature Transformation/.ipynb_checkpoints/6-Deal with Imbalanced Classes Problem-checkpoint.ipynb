    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Any real world dataset may come along with several problems. The problem of **imbalanced class** is one of them. The problem of imbalanced classes arises when one set of classes dominate over another set of classes. The former is called majority class while the latter is called minority class. It causes the machine learning model to be more biased towards majority class. It causes poor classification of minority classes. Hence, this problem throw the question of “accuracy” out of question. This is a very common problem in machine learning where we have datasets with a disproportionate ratio of observations in each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Imbalanced classes problem** is one of the major problems in the field of data science and machine learning. It is very important that we should properly deal with this problem and develop our machine learning model accordingly.  If this not done, then we may end up with higher accuracy. But this higher accuracy is meaningless because it comes from a meaningless metric which is not suitable for the dataset in question. Hence, this higher accuracy no longer reliably measures model performance.  \n"

    "The problem of imbalanced classes is very common and it is bound to happen. For example, in the above example the number of patients who do not have the rare disease is much larger than the number of patients who have the rare disease. So, the model does not correctly classify the patients who have the rare disease. This is where the problem arises.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of synthetic data generation, there is a powerful and widely used method known as **synthetic minority oversampling technique** or **SMOTE**. Under this technique, artificial data is created based on feature space. \n",
    "Artificial data is generated with bootstrapping and k-nearest neighbours algorithm.  It works as follows:-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tFirst of all, we take the difference between the feature vector (sample) under consideration and its nearest neighbour.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tThen we multiply this difference by a random number between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tThen we add this number to the feature vector under consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\tThus we select a random point along the line segment between two specific features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of **SMOTE** can best be illustrated with the following figure:-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![smote.png](attachment:smote.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, **SMOTE** generates new observations by interpolation between existing observations in the dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this jupyter notebook, I have discussed various approaches to deal with the problem of imbalanced classes. These are `random oversampling`, `random undersampling`, `tree-based algorithms`, `resampling with imbalanced learn library`, `under-sampling : Tomek links`,  `under-sampling : Cluster Centroids` and `over-sampling : SMOTE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some combination of these approaches will help us to create a better classifier.  Simple sampling techniques may handle slight imbalance whereas more advanced methods like ensemble methods are required for extreme imbalances.  The most effective technique will vary according to the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, based on the above discussion, we can conclude that there is no one solution to deal with the imbalanced classes problem. \n",
    "We should try out multiple methods to select the best-suited sampling techniques for the dataset in hand. The most effective technique will vary according to the characteristics of the dataset.\n"
